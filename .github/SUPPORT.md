# Support

GitHub issues are meant for enhancement requests and specific, reproducible bugs, not for general support questions.
Community support is available on WoredPress [forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/polylang/).
Also, we provide premium support through our paid plugins, please visit our [website](https://polylang.pro/support/).
